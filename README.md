# Z77-DS3H-Clover-Hotpatch-Patches

I decided to move my Z77-DS3H to Clover Hotpatch from a Regular DSDT.


Update 29-05-2017 Updated Patches now all in SSDT Hack. 






With the following SSDT everything works,
SSDT-EH01, SSDT-EH02, SSDT-HACK, SSDT-HDEF, SSDT-LAN, SSDT-MCHC, SSDT-SATA, SSDT-SMBUS, SSDT-XHC, SSDT-GFX0.

There is no SSDT-LPC as Device ID pci8086,1e44 is Native.
